     *
     * MusicKit is not able to determine the type of content from the ID alone,

     *
     * album / albums
     *
     * musicVideo / musicVideos
     *
     * playlist / playlists
     *
     * song / songs

     * @example
     * ```
     * const music = MusicKit.getInstance();
     *
     * // Create a new queue from a playlist
     *
     * await music.setQueue({ playlist: 'pl.d133de76fb4f4ccf98846231899874c0', startPlaying: true });

     * // Update the current queue to add a song after the currently playing one
     *
     * await music.playNext({ song: '1561837008' });
     * ```
     *
     * Setting Queue Content by URL
     * ---
     * As an abstracted way to play a media item or container (such as an album or playlist)
     * without first needing to know the type, you can provide a URL reference, which is commonly found under the
     * attributes of the Apple Music API response objects.
